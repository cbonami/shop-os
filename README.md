# Shop Microservice Demo

## Prerequisites

* Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
    * This step is optional, but very handy; I will use it to install various tools with it.

* Install [cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder)
    * Again, optional, but very handy as it emulates all linux commands on windows.
    
```bash
choco install cmder
```

* Install [MiniShift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift)

```bash
choco install virtualbox
choco install minishift
choco install openshift-cli
minishift config set vm-driver virtualbox
minishift config set cpus 4
minishift config set memory 16g
minishift start
```
